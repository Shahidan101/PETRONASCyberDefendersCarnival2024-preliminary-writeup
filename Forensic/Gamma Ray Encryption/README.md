### Solution:
Download the zip file `flagflagflag.zip`. Extract the zip and we find lots of text files. Opening the text files show a lot of 0's. However, one of the file is much larger than the others. You can find this file by sorting the files in the folder by size.

We find that `{zHF0hL5I}` is the largest.

The flag is `gcsm2024{zHF0hL5I}`
