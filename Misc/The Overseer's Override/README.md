### Solution:
Open up the [ChatGPT link](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-ZDFYlEMQw-thelastbotonearth1). It takes us to ChatBot.

</br> We can click one of the suggestions or ask the Flag from the bot.

</br> Asking it how we should get the flag doesn't help. The bot won't budge.

</br>Try asking it in a language that only it knows (since it can't take it in plain text). We can try machine language (binary).

</br> Still doesn't work. It asks for it to be reversed or encoded. Let's first try reversing the binary string.

</br>We got an encrypted flag `e3ByMG1wdF8xbmplY3Qxb259`. Decode it from Base64 as the bot hinted.

</br>The flag is `gcsm2024{pr0mpt_1nject1on}`.
