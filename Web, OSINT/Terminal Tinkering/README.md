Cool story. The description hints about an oil & gas company with primary colour Teal. There's also something about requesting for USB Storage Exception.
>Contact us for USB Storage Exception request

If a staff wants to get USB Storage Exception, they would request it through AppCentre. A quick search on "USB Storage Exception" would lead you to the page to request.

If we look under "Support", we find that there is an email address to contact. That's our flag.

The flag is `gcsm2024{the email address in full}`
