### Solution:
Download `QR.png`. If we scan the QR code, we'll get the first part of the flag `_th4_`.

We need to change the colours of the QR to get different parts of the flag. I used [StegSolve](https://github.com/manisashank/stegsolve/blob/master/process%20to%20install%20stegsolve).

Cycle through the different colour modes and adjustments until we get a different QR flag.

`Red plane 7` gets us `gcsm2024{c0l0r`

`Blue plane 7` gets us `QR}`

The flag is `gcsm2024{c0l0r_th4_QR}`
