### Solution:
Download the WAV file `The Tape.wav`. Have a listen and you'll find the flag just by translating the frequency of the audio into an image of the spectrum that contains the flag!

In all seriousness, the sound doesn't tell anything, not like a telephone dialtone, not Morse Code. Let's try putting it into a Spectrum Analyser. I used [this site](https://academo.org/demos/spectrum-analyzer/).

Upload the WAV file and click play.

The flag is `gcsm2024{SPECT0GR4M_H0L0T4PES}`
