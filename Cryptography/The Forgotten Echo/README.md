### Solution:
Download and open *audio.wav*. If you listen, it sounds like uniform *beeps*. If you listen to it often (maybe from lots of CTF practice), you'll notice it sounds like Morse Code.

Use a [Morse Code Audio Decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html). Upload the audio file and click "Play".

The flag is `gcsm2024{M0RS3_1S_T00_34SY}`, since it asks us to **replace any blank spaces with "_"**.
